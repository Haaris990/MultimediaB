		<p> Neurocognitive assessment and rehabilitation therapy using virtual reality represents a 
			sophisticated approach to addressing cognitive impairments resulting from neurological conditions or injuries. 
			This innovative methodology involves a multi-faceted process starting with comprehensive cognitive assessments 
			conducted within immersive virtual environments. These environments are meticulously designed to replicate real-world scenarios, 
			such as the example shown which is off a kitchen setting. This enables users to engage with tasks that assess various cognitive 
			domains such as memory, attention, executive functions, and spatial awareness. In this example we can see the user
			engage in many every day tasks you would complete in the kitchen like cooking/ <p>
		<p>  Through continuous refinement facilitated by machine learning algorithms, VR rehabilitation programs evolve to ensure optimal 
			 effectiveness and functional transfer of skills learned in VR to real-world contexts. In essence, neurocognitive assessment 
			 and rehabilitation therapy using virtual reality offer a promising and comprehensive approach to improving cognitive function 
			 and quality of life for individuals undergoing rehabilitation.
