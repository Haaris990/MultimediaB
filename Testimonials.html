		<p> According to a paper by G. Burdea, titled 'Virtual Rehabilitation - Benefits and Challenges', Virtual Rehabilitation has shown benefits for various patient populations.<p>
		<p>	These include: <p>
		<p>	Musculo-skeletal patients - Individuals who have suffered bone or muscle/ligament injuries. This would involve using VR technology for exercises such as peg-board exercises to improve hand-eye coordination. <p>
		<p> Post-stroke patients - VR-based rehabilitation has been effective for post-stroke chronic patients, even years after traditional therapy has stopped.<p>
		<p> Patients with cognitive impairments - Virtual Rehabilitation has been used for patients with cognitive deficits, such as those with attention deficits or post-traumatic stress disorder. VR technology can be tailored to address specific cognitive challenges and provide therapy. <p>
		<p> Patients with phobias or anxiety disorders - Virtual Reality has been utilised for exposure therapy in a safe and controlled environment. For example, patients with fear of spiders can undergo therapy in VR without real-life risks. <p>

		<p> Lucy Dunning, who is a professional, fully licensed counselor from Marietta, Georgia, uses virtual reality exposure therapy in her practice. In her experience so far, due to the concept being fairly recent, 
			the information on its long-term effectiveness is currently being gathered. <br> According to Dunning, “It has especially been shown to be successful for people with PTSD, anxiety and chronic pain”.<p>
		<div class="Tcol">
		<p> According to study published in JMIR Serious Games in 2022, virtual reality exposure treatment has been shown to improve cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) for individuals with PTSD, with success rates 
			ranging from 66% to 90%. <br>
			It is also demonstrated to be a highly effective pain reliever when used in place of prescription drugs. <br> 
			Burn victims were brought to a snowy environment in one research published in the Annals of Behavioural Medicine, where they interacted with snowmen and  snowballs. This reduced their physical pain between 35% and 50%.<p>
